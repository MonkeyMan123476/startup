  "description": "I have used GitHub before but it was for game development\r so I didn't really understand it, and it was super janky\r I feel like these quick instructions for it seem a lot\r simpler than I previously thought, and committing,\r pushing, pulling, and merging is much more understandable\r to me now.\r ## Elevator Pitch\r I want my start up application to be one where many people can create a story together, one sentence at a time.\r Users will have to log in, which will keep them from adding to the story until other users have added something,\r to keep people from spamming or hogging most of the story. I also plan on including a voting feature that lets\r users nominate a post for deletion, whether it be due to irrelevancy, spam, or inappropriate content. With enough\r votes, a post would be removed and the story can continue without it. It may also include a voting feature that\r allows a story to end if enough users are satisfied with a certain post as a conclusion, and then the story would\r be archived and a new one will begin. Other potential features could include letting users replying to other\r story posts or upload images to their own story contributions.\r ## Rough Sketch\r ![startup sketch](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/100855392/215245603-c5aec671-88ba-4558-ac5d-82760b9ffb33.JPG)\r ## Simon HTML Notes\r I learned quite a bit more about how different HTML files can link between each other, and I also learned a lot more\r about committing and pushing to GitHub when I am creating new files in VS Code. That gave me a bit of trouble, but\r I was able to figure it out and be able to write multiple files and have them show up in the repository after pushing\r them.\r ## Simon CSS Notes\r Even though I don't totally understand some of the code that was necessary, particularly for the design of the Simon\r play interface, I got a lot of experience using Bootstrap and actually seeing what different Bootstrap classes do\r to the elements on the webpage. I also had some fun looking up other Bootstrap button classes and switching the ones\r in the examples to other ones that I think fit better.\r # Startup HTML and CSS Notes\r Colors: #000035 #c9a959\r The majority of the work on this project so far has been figuring out forms, and using loads of dividers and sections \r to move, orient, and arrange things on the page in the way that I want them. The main color scheme that I chose for my startup is a navy blue (#000035) and a sort of dark tan (#c9a959). I also learned a lot about using bootstrap elements and how to override certain details in order to personalize them, which I used a lot with buttons, because the bootstrap buttons look great but I had to find ways to change the color, size, etc. I am interested in how it is going to work in the future to make the previous posts show up for every previous user, because right now I just have designs for example posts, but I am excited to learn how to actually have the number of posts necessary for all of the website's use.\r ## Simon JavaScript Notes\r I didn't totally understand how to implement what we've been learning into the website stuff, so this experience definitely helped with that. I now think I can figure out the basic JavaScript on my startup for things like logging in, and hopefully for at least storing someone's individual post, even though it might not display properly and won't display for everyone else. The biggest issue I had was that I did not notice the file of sound effects and it would not let Simon run at all, so I spent ages trying to fix it before I realized I just had to duplicate the assets folder. The main thing that I need to remember is that I still am not able to implement many of the features, so I shouldn't waste time trying to figure out things that will likely come later in the course. As long as I can get my startup to have a somewhat functional login and the text posts being stored SOMEWHERE, then I'm good. I can't let it stress me out as bad as it has the potential to.\r ## Midterm Notes\r < div > is division element",
