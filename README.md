Is this even working?
Yes, it seems to be working.
\n Direction 6 in VScode
\n Direction 6 in GitHub
## Notes
\nI have used GitHub before but it was for game development
\nso I didn't really understand it, and it was super janky
\nI feel like these quick instructions for it seem a lot
\nsimpler than I previously thought, and committing,
\npushing, pulling, and merging is much more understandable
\nto me now.
