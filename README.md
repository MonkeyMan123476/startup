# startup
### Notes
I have used GitHub before but it was for game development
so I didn't really understand it, and it was super janky
I feel like these quick instructions for it seem a lot
simpler than I previously thought, and committing,
pushing, pulling, and merging is much more understandable
to me now.
## Elevator Pitch
I want my start up application to be one where many people can create a story together, one sentence at a time.
Users will have to log in, which will keep them from adding to the story until other users have added something,
to keep people from spamming or hogging most of the story. I also plan on including a voting feature that lets
users nominate a post for deletion, whether it be due to irrelevancy, spam, or inappropriate content. With enough
votes, a post would be removed and the story can continue without it. It may also include a voting feature that
allows a story to end if enough users are satisfied with a certain post as a conclusion, and then the story would
be archived and a new one will begin. Other potential features could include letting users replying to other
story posts or upload images to their own story contributions.
